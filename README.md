# Fold Templates
A collection of templates for the fold framework.

These can be used as starting points for new services in your fold project.

You can access them via the fold command line tool, `foldctl`, with the
following command:

```
foldctl service new <type> <language>
```

For example, to use the 'basic' template with typescript as the language, you
would run the command:

```
foldctl service new basic ts
```
